Intercept AI: A Lexical Analysis Approach to Proactive Phishing Detection
      In the contemporary digital landscape, phishing remains a primary vector for cyberattacks, often circumventing traditional security measures that rely on static blacklists of known malicious domains. My Intercept AI project addresses this vulnerability by implementing a machine learning-based classification system that evaluates the structural and lexical "DNA" of a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) in real-time. By shifting the focus from historical reputation to structural intent, Intercept AI provides a proactive defense mechanism against zero-day phishing attempts.
      The technical methodology of Intercept AI involves a multi-stage data science pipeline. First, raw URL data is processed through a custom feature extraction engine that translates text strings into numerical vectors. Key metrics include URL length, subdomain depth, and the presence of obfuscating characters such as hyphens and "at" symbols (@). Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) reveals that phishing URLs often follow specific distribution patterns, clustering at higher character counts compared to benign links.
      For the classification task, a Random Forest algorithm was utilized due to its strong performance with high-dimensional tabular data. The model was trained on a balanced dataset of legitimate and verified malicious URLs, achieving high scores in both precision and recall. This ensures that while the system is highly sensitive to threats, it maintains a low false-positive rate, which is essential for user experience in security software.
      Ultimately, Intercept AI serves as a proof-of-concept for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in cybersecurity. Through the development of an investigation engine, the system not only generates a risk score but also itemizes specific threat indicators—such as raw IP usage or excessive path complexity—allowing security analysts to understand the rationale behind the AI's decision. Future development will focus on integrating real-time domain age verification and deploying the logic as a browser extension to provide end-to-end protection for users at the point of interaction.
